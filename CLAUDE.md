# Generative Studio

A generative design tool for creating compositions from simple shapes.

## Concept

Interactive controls (Structure, Density, Scale, Palette, Chaos) manipulate simple geometry (circles, rectangles, lines) organized into roles (Anchors, Accents, Texture) to produce varied compositions.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js + TypeScript
- Canvas API (HTML5 Canvas for rendering)
- Tailwind CSS for UI

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server
npm run build    # Production build

```
